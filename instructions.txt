ur first task is to implement the algorithms that we learned in class using a fixed size integer array, size of 10. (THIS IS YOUR DATA STRUCTURE) 
Using an iterative approach
Using a recursive approach
	
	ALGORITHMS:
Selective Sort
Insertion Sort
Shell Sort 		Note: Use Hibbard Sequence =  1, 3, 7, â€¦, (2*previous + 1)]
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Radix Sort
